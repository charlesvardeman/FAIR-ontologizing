# A CookieCutter Framework for Creating and Maintaining FAIR Ontologies and Controlled Vocabularies


This repository is a [CookieCutter](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/1.7.2/) template to do continuous integration of ontology development, a default structure and versioning of ontologies, automated testing and validation against SHACL shapes, and generation of documentation. [Github Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) are used to automate the ontology CI, testing, validation and publishing workflow.  It is encouraged as part of this workflow to use [gitflow](https://datasift.github.io/gitflow/) for managing the ontology development process.


For more information on creating FAIR ontologies, please read the excellent [Best Practices for Implementing FAIR Vocabularies and Ontologies on the Web](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.13084).
